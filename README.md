# Unhandled Division by Zero in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates an example of an unhandled division by zero error in JavaScript and its solution.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, which throws an error when dividing by zero. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that gracefully handles this edge case, preventing the application from crashing.

This is a common error but crucial for robust application development.
